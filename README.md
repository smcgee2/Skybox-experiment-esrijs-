# Skybox-experiment-esrijs-
Using pannellum.org and ArcGIS API for JavaScript together (syncing camera)

This isn't intended as a fully polished app. Just a bit of fun in an afternoon!

If you try to get the code to run, make sure you download a sky texture to place alongside it. It's worth searching for a "Equirectangular" skybox.

Thanks!
